# supermarket-order-parsing

To make: make
To run: ./p1 [input text file]

This project takes an input of Orders delineated by different keywords like:

CATEGORIES (either grocery electronics clothing home or health)

ORDERS (the line should follow this flow -> name of person, name of item, category, location)

DISPATCH (following this flow -> category, number of items to dispatch)


This should be stored in some sort of text file. I have a sample one, which is conveniently named input.txt. The program will output a nice output of the orders that will look like this:

-------------------------

Order Number: 2

Name: Jane Doe

Item: Phone

Ship to: Atlanta

-------------------------

Order Number: 1

Name: John Smith

Item: Ketchup

Ship to: Athens

-------------------------

This program was made to learn how to use queues, stacks, and linked lists properly.
