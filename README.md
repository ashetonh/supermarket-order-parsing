# supermarket-order-parsing

To make: make
To run: ./p1 [input text file]

This project takes an input of Orders delineated by different keywords like:
CATEGORIES (either grocery electronics clothing home or health)
ORDERS (the line should follow this flow -> name of person, name of item, category, location)
DISPATCH (following this flow -> category, number of items to dispatch)

This should be stored in some sort of text file. I have a sample one, which is conveniently named input.txt. The program will output a nice output of the orders that will look like this:

-------------------------
Order Number: 2
Name: Jane Doe
Item: Phone
Ship to: Atlanta
-------------------------
Order Number: 1
Name: John Smith
Item: Ketchup
Ship to: Athens
-------------------------

This program was made to learn how to use queues, stacks, and linked lists properly.
